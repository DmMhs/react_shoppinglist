# react_shoppinglist
Simple React-based shopping list. It provides the next functionality: add product with its  'amount' and 'measure' to a list, remove product from a list. Project is based on the Brice's Ayres 'todo list' video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCCW2y4wXNg&amp;t=1s&amp;list=LLyf8OuYbrpHOd3loOXtfB_g&amp;index=11].
